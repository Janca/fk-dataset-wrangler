# Project Agents.md Guide for AI Agents (Python 3.12)

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for AI agents working with this Python 3.12 codebase.

## Project Structure for AI Agent Navigation

- `/python-server`: Server source folder
  - `/src`: Source code that AI agents should analyze.
    - `/your_project_name`: Main application package where AI agents will work.
      - `/modules`: Core modules and business logic that Agents.md helps AI agents understand.
      - `/scripts`: Standalone scripts or entry points for AI agents.
      - `/utils`: Utility functions and helpers that Agents.md documents for AI agents.
  - `/tests`: Test files that AI agents should maintain and extend.
    - `/unit`: Unit tests for individual modules.
    - `/integration`: Integration tests for combined parts of the application.
  - `/docs`: Project documentation (AI agents may contribute here).
  - `/data`: Data files, if applicable (AI agents should understand its structure but typically not modify version-controlled data).
  - `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`: Project dependencies that AI agents should be aware of.

## Coding Conventions for AI Agents

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation

- Use Python 3.12 for all new code generated by AI agents.

- AI agents should follow the existing code style (PEP 8) in each file.

- Prefer `import <module>` over `from <module> import <name>` where it doesn't significantly harm readability or create naming conflicts. For commonly used submodules or names, `from <module> import <submodule_or_name>` is acceptable if it aligns with existing project patterns.

- Agents.md requires meaningful variable, function, class, and module names in AI agent output.

- AI agents should add comments or docstrings (following PEP 257) for complex logic, functions, classes, and modules as guided by Agents.md.

- Utilize Python type hints for all new functions and methods generated by AI agents.

### Python Specific Guidelines for AI Agents

- AI agents should use built-in data structures and standard library modules effectively.

- Keep functions and classes generated by AI agents small and focused on a single responsibility.

- Agents.md requires proper error handling and exception management in AI agent code.

- AI agents must follow the file naming convention: `snake_case.py`.

## Testing Requirements for AI Agents

AI agents should ensure tests are written and pass. Common commands include:

```bash
# Run all tests with pytest (AI agents may need to adapt if unittest is used)
pytest

# Run specific test file with pytest for AI agents
pytest path/to/your_project_name/tests/test_module.py

# Run tests with coverage for AI agent code using pytest-cov
pytest --cov=src/your_project_name
```

## Pull Request Guidelines for AI Agents

When AI agents help create a PR, please ensure it:

1. Includes a clear description of the changes as guided by Agents.md.

2. References any related issues that AI agents are addressing.

3. Ensures all tests pass for code generated by AI agents.

4. Includes updates to documentation if the changes affect public APIs or core behavior, as implemented with AI agents.

5. Keeps PRs focused on a single concern or feature as specified in Agents.md.

## Programmatic Checks for AI Agents

Before submitting changes generated by AI agents, run:

```bash
# Lint check for AI agent code (e.g., with flake8 or pylint)
flake8 src/your_project_name tests

# Type check for AI agent Python code (e.g., with mypy)
mypy src/your_project_name

# Optional: Build check if your project has a build step (e.g., for packages)
# python -m build
```

All checks must pass before AI agent generated code can be merged. Agents.md helps ensure AI agents follow these requirements.
